\section{Technical Skill Highlights}

\noindent
\jskill{Haskell}{I have made a CPU monitor, an assembler, a tic-tak-toe game, a lambda calculus solver, and a parcer/interpreter. This is my favoret language.}

\jskill{C++}{Wrote an OS simulation and visualizer, programmed an Arduino for my CPU Monitor, wrote a maze generator, and used for most of my college course work.}

\jskill{\LaTeX}{I wrote this r\'esum\'e, reports and memos for work, and mathimatic profes for homework.}

\jskill{Java}{Made many small games and desktop apps. Used in \frc\ and two years of highschool classes.}

\jskill{C\# \& Unity3d}{Expiramented with game programming and procedual generation. Made a music visualizer.}

\jskill{Bash}{Automated tasks such as compilation and testing. Used in the Linux CLI almost every day.}

\jskill{UNIX style 

\hfill workflow}{I use Linux as my primarey OS. For most projects I use Git and an automated build system with a pretty-printer and a linter. I prefer to stay away from monolithic IDE's.}

\section{Projects}

Nand2Tetris Test Script Bash
I developed a shell script that allows my classmates and me to run all of the tests for a homework project very quickly from the command line. This utility vastly improved my productivity.

Spider Game Unity3D, C\#
I developed a code module that allows players to walk on walls and moving objects much like a spider would.

Retro CPU Monitor Arduino, Python, Haskell
Using an Arduino, I built a physical "task manager" that is much more responsive and sensitive than its GUI counterparts.
