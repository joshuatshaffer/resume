\section{Technical Skill Highlights}

\noindent
\jskill{Haskell}{I have made a CPU monitor, an assembler, a tic-tak-toe game, a lambda calculus solver, and a parser/interpreter. This is my favorite language.}

\jskill{C++}{Wrote an OS simulation and visualizer, programmed an Arduino for my CPU Monitor, wrote a maze generator, and used for most of my college course work.}

\jskill{\LaTeX}{I wrote this r\'esum\'e, reports and memos for work, and mathematical proofs for homework.}

\jskill{Java}{Made many small games and desktop apps. Used in \frc\ and two years of high school classes.}

\jskill{C\# \& Unity3d}{Experimented with game programming and procedural generation. Made a music visualizer.}

\jskill{UNIX style 

\hfill work-flow}{I use Linux as my primary OS. For most projects I use Git and an automated build system such as Make or Cabal. I also use pretty-printers and linters such as clang-format to help enforce code quality. I tend to stay away from monolithic IDE's as they are not as flexible.}

\section{Focus and Passion}

\jskill{Functional 

\hfill Programming} {I was introduced to Haskell in the fall of 2016. Since then I have continued studying and have become very interested in the functional paradigm. I am most intrigued by it's benefits to code correctness, ease of maintenance, and ease of parallelization.}

\jskill{Robotics \& IoT}{I am very interested in how computing can be applied in the physical world and solve tangible problems. I also have a lifelong passion for the physical sciences and it's fun to mix the two.}

\jskill{Teaching}{I enjoy sharing these passions with others and I am often told that I have a natural talent for explaining things. I want to pursue this at some point in my career.}
