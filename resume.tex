\section{Projects}

Nand2Tetris Test Script Bash
I developed a shell script that allows my classmates and me to run all of the tests for a homework project very quickly from the command line. This utility vastly improved my productivity.

Spider Game Unity3D, C\#
I developed a code module that allows players to walk on walls and moving objects much like a spider would.

Retro CPU Monitor Arduino, Python, Haskell
Using an Arduino, I built a physical "task manager" that is much more responsive and sensitive than its GUI counterparts.
